🔄 AI Load/Unload Index

AI Context Tags for Automated Loading

@HRF → Load harmonic resonance framework context

@DMDB → Load dark matter database research

@TENSORDEV → Load private tensor work (if authorized)

@RESUME → Load resume review workflow

📝 Notes & Guidelines

Modules labeled ‘Private’ will not be included in public repositories.

AI directives are structured for automated AI session management (future implementation).

Updates to this index should reflect current research priorities and transition status of private-to-public work.

👥 Contributor Guidelines

New contributors must be approved before accessing private repositories.

Contributions should align with the structured research approach and follow modular design principles.

Use feature branches for development before merging into main branches.

All pull requests should include a brief summary of changes and rationale for modifications.

Contributors should adhere to the public/private transition framework—no unauthorized exposure of private research components.

📌 Versioning Policy

Major Releases (X.0.0): Significant framework updates, core module changes, or structural reworks.

Minor Updates (X.Y.0): New feature additions, small modular enhancements, or integration refinements.

Patch Fixes (X.Y.Z): Documentation updates, bug fixes, and optimizations.

Changelog:

Version updates should be logged in CHANGELOG.md for reference.

Each version increment should include a brief summary of changes and impact.

🤖 Automation & AI Integration

Automated AI session loading will be implemented using the AI Load/Unload Index for dynamic context switching.

Modular automation scripts will be developed to streamline data processing, validation, and testing workflows.

Future enhancements may include:

AI-driven tagging and prioritization of research components.

Automated batch processing of SDSS data retrieval and integration.

Dynamic model updates based on real-time data analysis.
