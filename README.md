# Harmonic Resonance AI: Exploring Efficiency in Machine Learning

## Overview
This project investigates the role of harmonic resonance in optimizing AI and ML efficiency. We aim to improve computational efficiency while maintaining model performance by applying resonant stride selection in sequence models. 

## Key Components
- **Resonant Stride Selection**: A novel token selection technique based on dominant frequency analysis.
- **PyTorch Implementation**: Code for inserting harmonic resonance principles into ML and AI models.
- **Fundamental Mass distribution predictor**: Inspiration for the tensor approach. 
- **Performance Comparisons**: Testing harmonic methods against standard approaches.
